    "This project explores why women in technology are more likely to experience limited career progression and leave the industry at higher rates than their male counterparts. Understanding these differences in career trajectories between men and women is essential for promoting fairness in the workplace, reducing costs associated with turnover, and improving overall organizational success by retaining diverse talent."

    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "Women in technology experience lower promotion rates and leave the industry at higher rates compared to their male counterparts, even when they have similar qualifications and experience. This disparity is driven by factors that disproportionately affect women, including a higher likelihood of layoffs and gender-based discrimination. As a result, women are less likely to reach senior positions or remain in the tech industry long-term.\n"

    "1. *Line Chart: Gender and Age Distribution in Technology*  \n",
    "A line chart will display the number of employees in the technology sector, separated by gender and age groups. The x-axis will represent the age groups (e.g., 20-25, 26-30, etc.), and the y-axis will show the number of employees. This chart will highlight the drop-off point where women begin to leave the industry earlier than men, helping visualize retention issues.\n",

    "2. *100% Stacked Column Chart: Men vs Women in Different Tech Roles*  \n",
    "A 100% stacked column chart will show the proportional representation of men and women across different tech roles (e.g., Junior Developers, Senior Developers, Managers, Executives). Each column will represent a different role, and the stacked columns will show the gender distribution within that role as a percentage. This will provide a clear visual of how underrepresented women are in higher-level positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Side-by-Side Column Chart: Workplace Concerns for Men vs Women*  \n",
    "A side-by-side column chart will compare the key workplace concerns between men and women, such as issues with career progression, work-life balance, pay disparity, and workplace discrimination. Each concern will have two columns‚Äîone representing men and one representing women. This will make it easy to see where concerns overlap and where significant differences exist between the genders."
