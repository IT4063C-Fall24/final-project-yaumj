BACKGROUND AND CODEBOOK
PEW RESEARCH CENTER
2017 STEM SURVEY

Background
This document provides background information and codebook details for those wishing to analyze the data from a 2017 Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults about careers and education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The survey had a sample size of 4,914 adults, 18 years of age or older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The survey was conducted by the GfK Group in English and Spanish using the KnowledgePanel, its nationally representative online research panel. KnowledgePanel members are recruited through probability sampling methods and include those with internet access and those who did not have internet access at the time of their recruitment (KnowledgePanel provides internet access for those who do not have it, and if needed, a device to access the internet when they join the panel).

The findings from this survey are detailed in the following report:

January 9, 2018 “Women and Men in STEM Often at Odds Over Workplace Equity”
http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/
Sample Design
The sample design for the survey was comprised of three groups: a group of about 2,500 panelists who said they were employed in a STEM occupation in a prior survey, a second group of about 1,900 panelists who were employed in a non-STEM occupation according to prior records, and a third group of about 500 eligible panelists to include other members of the general public including those who are not employed. Thus, the survey design oversamples employed adults and those employed in a science, technology, engineering or math occupation. In all, 8,995 panelists were invited to take part in the survey. The completion rate for this survey, that is the share of panelists invited to participate who completed the survey, was 62.9%. The cumulative response rate, calculated following Callegaro and DiSogra (2008), was 5%.
All respondents were asked to verify their current employment status. Updated occupation information was collected for all employed adults who indicated that their main job had changed since the time of completing their profile survey. Most respondents who said they worked in a STEM occupation were also asked an open-end question to describe their occupation in more detail. These responses were used for final classification as employed in a STEM or non-STEM job where they were available.
STEM occupations included the following job categories: computer and mathematical; architecture and engineering; life and physical sciences; medical doctors; other health care practitioners; health care technologists and technicians; and teachers (both K-12 and postsecondary) who specialize in a STEM subject. Healthcare support occupations and all other occupational categories were classified as non-STEM jobs. 
Note that since the survey was conducted in only English and Spanish, the sample of Asians working in STEM jobs are those with proficiency in English. There are not enough Asians working in non-STEM jobs for separate analysis in this survey. 
Margins of error
The margins of error table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey.

The survey’s margin of error is the largest 95% confidence interval for any estimated proportion based on the total sample – the one around 50%. The margin of error for the entire sample is ±2.7 percentage points. This means that in 95 out of every 100 samples drawn using the same methodology, estimated proportions based on the entire sample will be no more than 2.7 percentage points away from their true values in the population. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance used in this report take into account the effect of weighting. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

Weighting
The data were weighted in a multistep process that begins with a base weight that accounts for differences in probability of selection into the study. Respondents were divided into four mutually exclusive subgroups 1) STEM workers, excluding STEM teachers 2) non-STEM workers, excluding non-STEM teachers 3) Teachers, both STEM and non-STEM 4) Non-workers. Each of these groups was separately weighted using an iterative technique to match population benchmarks. Next, the weighting combined all workers and aligned the combined group to population benchmarks for all workers. In a final step, workers (both STEM and non-STEM) were combined with non-workers, and the weights were further adjusted so that each group’s relative proportions and demographic profile matched estimates for all U.S. adults. At each stage, the resulting weights were trimmed and scaled to the number of completed surveys. 
Population benchmarks included: gender by age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, region by metropolitan status, and primary language. Primary language parameters come from the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey; all other parameters come from the March 2016 Current Population Survey (CPS). 
Protection of Respondent Confidentiality
As a matter of policy to maintain confidentiality, the Pew Research Center does not release respondent names, contact numbers or any other identifying information. In order to maintain confidentiality, some variables may have been deleted from the dataset or collapsed into categories before being released. These changes include deleting all open-end responses, deleting some geographic data, such as state and collapsing and truncating other variables such as number of science and math courses.
CODEBOOK

This section describes the variables included in the dataset. It first includes information on variables not included in the questionnaire, which includes paradata and profile variables from respondents. The codebook also includes any variables from the questionnaire that were truncated or collapsed. It then includes a copy of the questionnaire, which provides information on variables from the questionnaire, including variable names, values and value labels.
