# # {Breaking the Glass Firewall: Exploring Salary and Career Disparities Between Men and Women in Tech}üìù
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# This project investigates the disparities in salary, career opportunities, and workplace treatment between men and women in the tech industry. Despite having similar qualifications and experience, women in technology face significant barriers to reaching senior positions and earning competitive salaries compared to their male counterparts. Understanding these differences in career trajectories is essential for promoting fairness in the workplace, reducing turnover costs, and improving organizational success by retaining diverse talent.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# How do salaries, workplace treatment, and job roles for women compare to those for men at similar career stages in the tech industry?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# **Hypothesis:**  
# In the tech industry, women with similar qualifications and experience as men earn lower salaries, face more challenges in workplace treatment, and are often relegated to less senior roles. These disparities are influenced by factors that disproportionately affect women, including gender-based discrimination and limited access to career advancement opportunities. As a result, women are less likely than men to achieve competitive salaries or reach senior positions, impacting their long-term career trajectories and earning potential in the industry.

# ## Data Sources
# *What data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# **Data Sources**  
# - *HackerRank 2018 Developer Survey (Kaggle):* Published in 2018, based on 2017 survey responses. Primarily focuses on respondents' job roles and educational backgrounds, providing insights into positioning within the tech industry based on qualifications.  
# - *Pew Research Center 2017 STEM Survey (zip file):* Based on 2017 responses, this survey includes data on gender representation and experiences in STEM fields.  
# - *NSF's National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (Web-Scraped Tables):* Covering data over multiple years, ending in 2019, with an emphasis on STEM workforce statistics.  
# - *NSF's National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (zip folders with xlsx files):* A supplementary set of tables spanning several years, ending in 2019, offering additional STEM field statistics.  
# - *From College to Jobs American Community Survey 2019 (U.S. Census Bureau xls files):* Detailed data about occupations, salaries, gender, and educational backgrounds for a comprehensive view of career outcomes. 
# 
# **Relating the Data**  
# - The datasets can be linked based on the several criteria for consistency:
#     - All of the data is part of a shared timeframe of all of the data (2017-2019).  
#     - Gender will be limited to only male or female. Anyone who did not answer or chose non-binary will be excluded from analysis.
#     - Responses will be limited to the United States. 
#     - Only data where the individual works in a STEM career will be included.
#     - Ages will be limited to the 25 - 64 range to match the American Community Survey data, ensuring consistency across employment data.
#     - The analysis will focus on individuals who were employed at the time of each survey, and each dataset will be filtered accordingly.
# 

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# After limiting each dataset to core demographics (e.g., country, age, gender, employment status, employment field), I will analyze trends across individual datasets and determine if the responses are similar for the other datasets. As an example, both the HackerRank and Pew Research Center surveys have data about job search criteria, so recreating the same visualization type on each will allow me to observe patterns related to gender disparities.
# 
# **Planned Visualizations to Support the Hypothesis:**
# 1. *Line Chart: Gender and Age Distribution in Technology*  
# A line chart will display the number of employees in the technology sector, separated by gender and age groups. The x-axis will represent the age groups (e.g., 20-25, 26-30, etc.), and the y-axis will show the number of employees. This chart will highlight the drop-off point where women begin to leave the industry earlier than men, helping visualize retention issues.
# 
# 2. *100% Stacked Column Chart: Men vs Women in Different Tech Roles*  
# A 100% stacked column chart will show the proportional representation of men and women across different tech roles (e.g., Junior Developers, Senior Developers, Managers, Executives). Each column will represent a different role, and the stacked columns will show the gender distribution within that role as a percentage. This will provide a clear visual of how underrepresented women are in higher-level positions.
# 
# 3. *Side-by-Side Column Chart: Workplace Concerns for Men vs Women*  
# A side-by-side column chart will compare the key workplace concerns between men and women, such as issues with career progression, work-life balance, pay disparity, and workplace discrimination. Each concern will have two columns‚Äîone representing men and one representing women. This will make it easy to see where concerns overlap and where significant differences exist between the genders.
# 
# ### UPDATE: Plan Revisions After Exploratory Data Analysis:
# - After the initial exploratory data analysis, the visualization choices were adjusted to better align with the patterns emerging in the raw data.

# #### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights:
# - The dataset is global, not local, meaning it does not precisely align with my other datasets.
#     - Information from the country_code_df can be used to identify the country code and country name format so I can filter the other dataframes to only include the United States
# - The datset includes NaN values in several fields including the country. 
#     - Data will need to be explored further to determine the handling of NaN or #NULL! values
#         - For example, if the NaN or NULL value is in gender or country, it cannot be determined using other methods and needs to be excluded from analysis. However,
#         if the NaN or NULL is in the Job Level or Current Rank field, I may be able to populate those fields based on data from similar records.
# - The Numeric and Values datasets have identical infomation, just in different formats.
#     - In the Numeric dataset, all of the values are numerically coded.
#     - In the Values dataset, all of the responses are in plain English.
# - There are outliers in this data as far as what can be directly related to my other datasets and my hypothesis for the purpose of analysis.
#     - Age ranges will need to be limited to match what is available in the datasets from other sources to make "apples to apples" comparisons.

# #### Matplotlib Stacked Bar Chart: Job Criteria Priorities by Gender (Normalized)
# **Purpose:** Compare the importance of various job criteria between men and women in the technology sector, using a stacked bar chart that has been normalized to account for the gender imbalance of respondents in the dataset.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **Work-Life Balance as Top Priority:** *Work-Life Balance* ranks as the highest priority for women (60.1%) and is also highly valued by men (56%). This could reflect broader societal expectations, where women are often primary caretakers, balancing professional responsibilities with family obligations. While this dataset doesn‚Äôt confirm this directly, it aligns with common trends observed in gender studies.
# - **Professional Growth and Learning Priority:** Women place a significantly higher value on *Professional Growth and Learning* (54.6%) compared to men (44.9%). This aligns with findings from the Pew Research Center, suggesting that women, who often face challenges with gender discrimination, prioritize opportunities for advancement and skill development more heavily.
# - **Company Culture Importance:** *Company Culture* ranks higher for women (44.2%) than for men (39.0%), possibly reflecting women‚Äôs desire for supportive and inclusive workplace environments in light of reported experiences of exclusion and discrimination.
# - **Compensation Comparison:** For women, *Compensation* is the fourth most important job criterion (41.2%), following *Work-Life Balance* (60.1%), *Professional Growth and Learning* (54.6%), and *Company Culture* (44.2%). This suggests that while pay disparities are significant, women may prioritize job factors that foster long-term satisfaction and career advancement over salary alone when choosing an employer.
# - **Low-Value Criteria for Both Genders:** *Funding and Valuation*, *Stability of a Large Company*, and *Perks* all show low prioritization across both genders, with less than 10% of respondents marking them as essential. This indicates that while job security and benefits matter, they are not primary factors in job selection for either group.
# 
# **Summary:** The findings reinforce the hypothesis that women in tech value career advancement opportunities, inclusive workplace culture, and work-life balance over compensation alone. These insights highlight the importance of creating growth-oriented, flexible, and supportive environments to retain female talent in the technology industry.

# #### Data Visualization using Matplotlib Bar Graph
# **Purpose:** Provide an initial demographic breakdown of the HackerRank dataset by age and gender to establish a baseline understanding of workforce composition, which informs the need for further analysis on gender representation across job levels.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **Age Group Representation**: The distribution of workers by age group reveals a strong representation in the 25‚Äì34 and 35‚Äì44 age groups, which are critical career-building stages.
# - **Gender Disparity in Age Groups**: Male respondents dominate all age groups, particularly in the 25‚Äì34 range, indicating a potential gender imbalance that could influence job levels and advancement opportunities.
# - **Next Steps in Analysis:** Given the evident gender imbalance, further analysis will explore how this demographic distribution correlates with job levels. Examining job levels across genders and age groups can identify whether disproportionate career progression patterns exist. Additional visualizations, such as a stacked bar chart by job level and gender or a heatmap for job level concentration, will deepen the understanding of gender-based trends in career advancement.

# #### Additional Exploratory Data Analyis (EDA) for Data Relevance
# - Determine if records where Job Level = New grad have current roles other than "unemployed" to decide if they should be included in analysis.
# - Look for records where the Job Level is NaN but the Current Role is not NaN.
#     - These records can be used with machine learning classification to populate missing values.

# In[17]:


# Review dataset to determine what data is relevant

# Check Current Role for Job Level "New grad"
new_grad_roles = filtered_us_dev_survey_values_df[filtered_us_dev_survey_values_df['Job Level'] == 'New grad'] \

# #### More Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# - Check if there is a dominant job level associated with the Current Role field that could be used to populate empty fields.

# In[18]:


# Group by Current Role and Job Level, and count occurrences
role_level_counts = filtered_us_dev_survey_values_df.groupby(['Current Role', 'Job Level']).size().reset_index(name='Counts')

# Set the option to display all rows for this code cell only

    display(role_level_counts)


# #### Data Visualization using Seaborn Box Plot
# **Purpose:** Demonstrate how gender may impact job levels within specific career roles, in this case, "Development Operations Engineer." This is to support the use of a machine learning approach to populate empty fields. Machine learning can adapt to demographic differences, rather than relying on single-point estimates like the mean or median for classification.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **Gender-based Distribution Differences:** 
#     - The box plot shows a significant disparity in job level distribution by gender within the "Development Operations Engineer" role. 
#     - **Male Distribution:** Males exhibit a broader range of job levels, with a median at the Senior Developer level. This distribution includes representation across higher job levels, such as Principal Engineer and Engineering Manager, suggesting greater advancement opportunities or a wider presence in senior roles for men within this career path. 
#     - **Female Distribution:** Females, on the other hand, are primarily clustered at the Level 1 Developer (junior) level, with no representation above the Freelancer level in this role. This limited range could indicate barriers to progression or underrepresentation in senior positions, reflecting broader industry challenges women face in advancing within technical roles.
# 
# - **Rationale for Machine Learning Approach:** 
#     - Given these clear disparities in job level distribution by gender, a machine learning model like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is well-suited for predicting job levels. KNN can capture complex relationships between demographic features (such as gender) and job levels, providing a more nuanced prediction than simple averages or medians.
#     - By considering demographic factors, this approach enables the model to better reflect real-world patterns of representation and career advancement, offering a data-driven perspective on disparities within roles across the dataset.

# #### Seaborn Strip Plot: Distribution of Job Levels by Gender within Each Age Group
# **Purpose:** Visualize the distribution of job levels across genders within each age group in the technology sector, providing insights into potential patterns of gender representation and career progression at different stages of professional life.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **25‚Äì34 Age Group:** Men and women are represented at all job levels from New grad to Engineering Manager. However, Founder/CEO/CTO roles are exclusively occupied by men, and multiple data points at this level indicate that this is not an isolated outlier. Additionally, men appear to have continuous representation across all job levels, while higher levels for women, such as Principal Engineer, Architect, and Engineering Manager, display distinct individual points. This suggests lower representation for women in higher roles at this career stage.
# - **35‚Äì44 Age Group:** Both genders are represented across all job levels, including Founder/CEO/CTO, showing relatively balanced representation in this age range. This distribution may indicate that women who reach this age group achieve a broader range of job levels than in earlier career stages.
# - **45‚Äì54 Age Group:** There is a noticeable reduction in representation, particularly for women. In this group, women are clustered around Level 1 Developer (junior) and Senior Developer, with only a single outlier at Engineering Manager. Men continue to show representation across more levels, indicating a possible disparity in advancement opportunities as careers progress.
# - **55‚Äì64 Age Group:** Men are represented across several senior roles, from Senior Developer to Engineering Manager. Women, however, are predominantly clustered at Senior Developer, with sparse representation at Level 1 Developer (junior), Architect, and Engineering Manager. This pattern may reflect limited opportunities for women to progress to higher roles at later career stages.
# 
# **Summary:** The visualization highlights potential gender-based differences in career progression. Women in the 25‚Äì34 age group appear to be underrepresented in higher roles, with the disparity becoming more pronounced in later career stages (45‚Äì54 and 55‚Äì64 age groups). This analysis suggests that women in tech may face challenges in advancing to senior positions as they progress in their careers, potentially reflecting systemic barriers to higher-level roles.

# #### Matplotlib Stacked Bar Chart: Job Choice Priorities by Gender (Normalized)
# **Purpose:** Recreate the HackerRank survey analysis with Pew Research Center data to validate findings on job choice priorities by gender in the technology and STEM fields. This chart has been both weighted and normalized to reflect the gender imbalance in respondents and the demographic adjustments applied in the Pew Research Center dataset.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **Work-Life Balance as Top Priority:** Both women (76.6%) and men (72.5%) consider *Work-Life Balance* crucial when choosing a job, consistent with the HackerRank survey. This emphasizes the importance of flexible work environments in addressing the demands of professional and personal life balance for both genders.
# - **Higher Emphasis on Helping Others and Contribution to Society by Women:** Women in the Pew Research Center data place significantly more value on *Helping Others* (57.9% for women vs. 28.5% for men) and *Contribution to Society* (60.4% for women vs. 49.5% for men). In contrast, the HackerRank survey reported lower ratings for *Company Mission* and *Product Impact* for both genders, suggesting that while women in the Pew sample prioritize purpose-driven work, this emphasis was not as pronounced in the HackerRank survey. This could reflect differing values or motivations across these two groups of respondents.
# - **Company Culture as a Key Factor:** *Company Culture* remains a higher priority for women (53.2%) compared to men (48.3%)in the Pew Research Center data, echoing findings from the HackerRank survey (44.2% for women vs. 39.0% for men). This preference underlines the importance of inclusive, supportive work environments for women in STEM fields.
# - **Compensation as a Higher Priority for Men:** *Compensation* is more highly prioritized by men than women in both surveys, with Pew Research Center data showing 60.3% for men vs. 47.6% for women, and HackerRank showing 56.9% for men vs. 41.2% for women. This consistent trend suggests that, although compensation is important, it may not be the foremost factor for women in STEM.
# - **Contrasting Trends in Professional Growth Priorities:** The *Professional Growth* findings between the two surveys reveal nearly opposite trends. In the HackerRank survey, women rated *Professional Growth and Learning* higher than men (54.6% for women vs. 44.9% for men). However, in the Pew Research Center data, men prioritized *Professional Growth* more (57.5% for men vs. 46.3% for women). This discrepancy may indicate varied career motivations between the samples, with HackerRank respondents possibly focusing more on career advancement opportunities for women than their counterparts in the Pew Research Center survey.
# 
# **Methodology Consideration:** It is important to note a key difference in methodology: the HackerRank survey required respondents to select exactly three job priorities, whereas the Pew Research Center survey allowed respondents to choose any number of priorities or none at all. This flexibility in the Pew Research Center survey may have influenced the distribution of choices, allowing for a broader expression of priorities compared to the forced-choice format of the HackerRank survey. Additionally, the Pew data incorporates a weighting factor to adjust for demographic representation, adding rigor to the analysis but potentially influencing comparisons with the HackerRank data.
# 
# **Summary:** This analysis of the Pew Research Center data generally supports the trends observed in the HackerRank survey, particularly around work-life balance and company culture. However, the contrasting findings for professional growth and the emphasis on helping others and societal contribution underscore that motivations can vary widely across STEM fields. These insights emphasize the importance of creating flexible, purpose-driven, and growth-oriented workplaces to effectively retain a diverse workforce in technology and STEM.

# #### Seaborn Heatmap: Concentration of Discrimination Experiences by Age Group and Gender (Weighted Counts)
# **Purpose:** This heatmap visualizes the concentration of reported discrimination experiences across age groups and gender, using weighted counts from the Pew Research Center data. By applying weighting factors, this chart provides a more representative view of how these experiences vary across demographics, especially by age and gender.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **High Concentration of Negative Experiences for Younger Women:** Women aged 25‚Äì34 report notably high weighted counts in experiences such as *Earning Less than Opposite Gender Counterpart* (21.5), *Experiencing Microaggressions* (18.2), and *Being Treated as Incompetent* (22.8). These elevated counts suggest significant barriers for younger women in the workforce, particularly in terms of respect and equitable treatment. 
#   
# - **Persisting Challenges for Women Aged 35‚Äì44:** In the 35‚Äì44 age group, women continue to report substantial discrimination experiences, including *Earning Less* (14.8), *Microaggressions* (10.4), *Receiving Less Senior Support* (11.5), and *Being Treated as Incompetent* (13.1). These experiences highlight ongoing barriers to career advancement and the importance of mentorship and support in the workplace. The need for a supportive company culture may be particularly strong in this group as they strive for professional growth and equity.
# 
# - **Decreasing but Consistent Reports in Later Career Stages:** For women aged 45‚Äì54, notable experiences include *Earning Less* (11.3) and *Being Treated as Incompetent* (11.3), while women aged 55‚Äì64 still report *Earning Less* (14.0) and *Being Treated as Incompetent* (10.2). Although these counts are slightly lower than in younger age groups, they indicate that discriminatory treatment persists throughout many women's careers, possibly impacting their satisfaction and retention in STEM fields.
# 
# - **Comparative Low Reports for Men Across All Age Groups:** Men report much lower weighted counts for these discrimination experiences across all age groups, suggesting they encounter these issues less frequently than women. This difference further highlights why women, compared to men, may prioritize company culture as a significant factor when evaluating job opportunities.
# 
# **Methodology Consideration:** This visualization uses weighted counts, which adjust each reported experience according to the demographic representation in the Pew Research Center dataset. These adjustments help reflect the actual prevalence of discrimination experiences in the workforce more accurately.
# 
# **Summary:** The analysis reveals that younger and mid-career women (ages 25‚Äì44) encounter the highest concentration of discrimination experiences, especially in terms of earning disparities, microaggressions, and perceived incompetence. These trends emphasize the need for supportive and equitable workplace cultures, as these factors likely influence why women place high value on company culture when considering job opportunities in STEM fields.

# #### Matplotlib Area Chart: Comparison of Women in S&E Degrees vs. S&E Occupations (1993, 2003, 2019)
# **Purpose:** This area chart provides a comparison of the growth in the number of women earning degrees in science and engineering (S&E) fields versus the number of women employed in S&E occupations. By overlaying these two trends, this visualization highlights potential disparities between education and workforce participation in Science and Engineering for women.
# 
# **Insights:**
# - **Significant Growth in S&E Degree Attainment:** From 1993 to 2019, the number of women earning degrees in S&E fields increased by approximately 202.67%, reflecting substantial progress in encouraging women to pursue studies in these fields. This trend suggests that more women are being equipped with the qualifications necessary for careers in science and engineering.
# 
# - **Lagging Workforce Representation Despite Educational Gains:** Over the same period, the increase in the number of women in S&E occupations was approximately 190.4%, a slower growth rate than the increase in degree attainment, suggesting that barriers may still prevent women from entering or advancing in S&E careers.
# 
# - **Indications of Structural Barriers:** The gap between educational achievement and workforce representation suggests that women in S&E fields may face structural or cultural barriers limiting their entry and advancement in these careers. These barriers likely impact not only individual career progression but also overall industry diversity and innovation potential.
# 
# **Summary:** This area chart emphasizes the challenge of translating educational advancements for women in S&E into equivalent representation in S&E occupations. Although women are earning degrees in S&E fields at increasing rates, this academic progress does not appear to be fully mirrored in workforce participation. This demonstrates that many women are encountering barriers to even entering into S&E fields, impacting their long-term career trajectories in the Science and Engineering Industry. These findings underscore the need for supportive, equitable workplace practices to bridge the gap between education and career progression for women in S&E.

#     - Over the next 8 years (first measured interval), the male median salary increased by 20.3%, whereas the female median salary increased by only 17.0%. This disproportionate increase further widened the gap between male and female earnings.
# - **Persistent Disparity by 2019:**  
#     - At the next interval, 16 years later, both genders saw an identical salary increase of 3.6%. However, the male median salary reached $86,000, while the female median salary only rose to $57,000. This resulted in an even larger wage gap, with a final disparity of 33.72%.
# 
# This interactive visualization highlights the long-standing and widening disparity in median salaries between genders. The unequal salary increases at crucial intervals have exacerbated the wage gap, emphasizing how systemic disparities in salary growth prevent women from closing the gap in career fields that require science and engineering degrees.

# #### Exploratory Data Analyis on Census Tables
# - The excel spreadsheet includes explanations of the data that spans several rows at the top and bottom of the data
#     - This means that rows need to be specifically extracted or excluded 
# - The census tables have headings and subheadings in the columns
#     - This means the columns need to be renamed to reflect the discriptive header rather than the repetitive subheading
# - The table contents are divided by row with a heading indicating the categorization in the rows following the row's subheading (e.g. male, female, white, hispanic)
#     - This means specific rows need to be extracted to ensure the data is only what is needed for analysis

# #### Generate a Stacked Bar Chart using Matplotlib to compare the dataframes
# **Purpose:** Analyze the distribution of fields of degree by occupation across genders, focusing on the highest concentrations of careers and how degree backgrounds vary between men and women.
# 
# **Insights:**
# 
# - **Career Concentration by Gender:**
#   - For **men**, the occupation with the highest representation is **Managers (Non-STEM)**, highlighting a strong presence in managerial roles outside of science and engineering fields.
#   - For **women**, **Education** has the highest concentration, with a significant representation also seen in **Healthcare** roles, underscoring these fields as primary career paths for women in the dataset.
# 
# - **Gender Disparities in STEM Roles:** 
#   - **Men** are much more likely to be employed as **Computer Workers** and **Engineers**, even when they hold degrees seemingly unrelated to these fields, such as **Liberal Arts and History**. This suggests a broader acceptance or hiring trend for men in technical roles, regardless of their field of study.
#   - **Women** have comparatively lower representation in technical fields like Computer Work and Engineering, which may indicate potential barriers to entry or differing career choices despite educational background.
# 
# - **Healthcare Sector Dominance by Women:** Women overwhelmingly dominate roles in **Healthcare**, aligning with the degree distributions in fields like **Biological, Environmental, and Agricultural Sciences**. This suggests a continued trend of women pursuing healthcare-related careers.
# 
# - **Cross-Disciplinary Employment Trends:** The visualizations reveal that while men frequently cross into technical roles with non-STEM degrees, women tend to stay within fields closely aligned with their degree, such as **Education** and **Social Services**.
